# Contribution guidelines

Keep in mind that the list is very mature by now, so the bar of getting something accepted is high. Only submit something unique and generally useful.

  - **If you just created something, wait at least 30 days before submitting** to give it some time to mature and ensure it's not just a publish-and-forget type of project
  - Actively maintained:
    - Regular, recent commits
    - Or, for finished projects, issues and pull requests are responded to
  - Ensure your work follows general quality rules ([Crystal Shards 101](https://github.com/mccallofthewild/crystal-shards-101) if this is a Crystal shard)
  - Run `crystal spec` before submitting a PR
